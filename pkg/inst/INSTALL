To install RBerkeley, it is required that you have the BerkeleyDB 4.7.25
version or greater installed in the standard place. Other versions may or may
not work, depending on supported features.

At present, only *nix systems have been tested, including
Ubuntu and OSX.  Other systems and Windows builds are desired,
but are not an internal priority.  Contributors welcome!

It is currently set to the default installation location of DB when
built from source.  If yours differs, please change the environment
variables accordingly:

    PKG_LIBS= -L/usr/local/BerkeleyDB.4.7/lib -ldb
    PKG_CFLAGS= -I/usr/local/BerkeleyDB.4.7/include

#  NOTE:  This doesn't seem to work correctly anymore
#
#Alternately, one may pass configuration parameters to
#R CMD INSTALL with '--configure-args'
#
#    R CMD INSTALL \
#      --configure-args="--with-berkeleydb-lib=-L/usr/local/lib \
#                        --with-berkeleydb-inc=-I/usr/local/include" \
#      RBerkeley_*.*-*.tar.gz

The configure script will attempt to locate a usable
DB installation (including headers) automatically.  If
this fails, it is recommended to try the above methods,
and if further issues occur, to email the package maintainer
with a report of the problems encountered.

A final step required to successfully load and run the software
will be to add the DB library path to your linker if the
library is in a non-standard location:

Using something like:

bash$ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="/usr/local/BerkeleyDB.4.7/lib"

or running ldconfig

Good luck!
