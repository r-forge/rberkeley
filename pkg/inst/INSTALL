To install RBerkeley, it is required that you have the BerkeleyDB 4.7.25
version installed in the standard place.

This package makes use of a Makevars file in the src directory.

It is currently set to the default installation location of DB when
built from source.  If yours differs, please change the Makevars accordingly:

    PKG_LIBS= -L/usr/local/BerkeleyDB.4.7/lib -ldb
    PKG_CFLAGS= -I/usr/local/BerkeleyDB.4.7/include

A configuration script to automate this is on the way...
